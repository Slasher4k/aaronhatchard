              <p>Your website is the key to making a great first impression on your clients. And the easiest way to make that impression is with the world’s most popular website platform: WordPress.</p>
              <p>With WordPress, you can manage your website with zero programming knowledge, easily incorporate useful plugins, and customise your site’s look as much or as little as you want.</p>
              <p>All you need is a WordPress developer to set up your site in the first place. And that’s where I come in.</p>

              <p>Unlike your best friend’s sister’s boyfriend (who read about WordPress once and offered to help you “on the cheap”), as your local Brisbane WordPress developer, I know how to create a website that will “wow”. I take the time to thoroughly discuss what you’re looking for so I can develop the WordPress website you want and need. Because I only work with one client at a time, you and your site receive my full attention from start to finish. Whether this is your first website or your thirty-first, I can help.</p>

              <p>I help you create a site you and your clients will love. This includes choosing the right theme (or converting your designer’s mock-up into WordPress reality) and sourcing and installing the right plugins for you. If you don’t already have images and words for your site, I can also hook you up with my design and copywriting partners.</p>

              <p>I seamlessly migrate your existing website to WordPress so you can manage and use it with ease. Depending on your goals, we can keep your site’s current look and feel or (if it’s as square as Spongebob Squarepants) we can update it to a custom design or your chosen theme. Either way, I take care of every step so your website makes the right first impression, every time.</p>

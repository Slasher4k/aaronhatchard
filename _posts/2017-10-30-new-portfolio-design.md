Welcome to my redesigned site.

When it can time to give my site a redesign I started the design as a plain html file, but as you'd expect, once you have more than one page and have repeating elements like the header and footer you don't want to keep repeating yourself. For my last design I had made a WordPress theme but this time around I wanted to try, and learn, something new so I decided to make this site with "Jeykll", a blog-aware static site generator. 

To keep the load time fast and page sizes small I also opted to avoid the jQuery library and use plain javascript.

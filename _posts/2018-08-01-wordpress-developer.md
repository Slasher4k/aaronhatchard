A WordPress developer is a web developer who builds and works on websites using the WordPress platform.

This contrasts with many WordPress website designers (e.g. your best friend’s cousin’s former room-mate or the girl you found when you googled “cheap WordPress designers”).

The main difference?

A WordPress developer has a deep understanding of the two key coding ingredients for any website: HTML and CSS.

And that brings with it some pretty great benefits.

## The not-so-secret languages your website needs

The advantage of using a WordPress developer to create your website is that you have **someone who speaks the not-so-secret languages your website needs if you want to change anything** – anything at all – that isn’t already built into your chosen WordPress theme. 

Many WordPress website designers can take care of the “drag and drop” that comes with building a simple website from a pre-set theme. And that’s great. But they aren’t going to be much help if you need to add button X to page Y and that’s not already an option for your particular theme.

## Customise, customise, customise

The other advantage of working with a WordPress developer comes when you want to **combine the your-grandma-could-do-it ease of the WordPress platform with a custom website design**.

Perhaps you have some very specific requirements for your site. Maybe you need to incorporate a custom plugin. Or it could simply be that you can’t find an existing theme that meets your aesthetic vision or your brand’s style.

If you see yourself in any of those situations (or you just want a custom site, dammit!) then a WordPress developer is exactly what you’re looking for.


## What do you need?

You may only want and need a simple website for your business. And if that’s the case, any reputable WordPress website designer ought to be able to help you. 

But if you want to customise your site – or you simply want the peace of mind that comes from knowing your designer speaks your website’s language – then a WordPress developer is the way to go.
